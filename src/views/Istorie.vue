        In the interwar period, Grand Prix races were organized on all continents, making it increasingly evident that these competitions should be united under the umbrella of a world championship. These plans were halted by the Second World War, but in 1946, the FIA decided to establish such a world championship. From the 25 Grand Prix races organized in 1949, seven were selected to be the inaugural stages of the first Formula 1 World Championship, organized in 1950. These were: the British Grand Prix, the Monaco Grand Prix, the United States Grand Prix, the Swiss Grand Prix, the Belgian Grand Prix, the French Grand Prix, and the Italian Grand Prix.

        The Formula 1 World Championship began on May 13, 1950, when the British Grand Prix was held at Silverstone, on a circuit improvised on a former military airport used during the war. This was also the only Formula 1 race to take place on a Saturday, with all subsequent races being held on Sundays. The reason was that, at the time, sports competitions were prohibited on Sundays in Great Britain.

        In 1954, the FIA lifted the ban on German teams participating, allowing Mercedes-Benz to debut in the championship at the French Grand Prix. They recruited Juan Manuel Fangio, who was then leading the championship with his own Maserati. Mercedes-Benz's dominance was as absolute as Ferrari's in previous years, with the Germans winning nine of the twelve races they entered. Without Mercedes-Benz, Formula 1 became a Ferrari affair, as Scuderia Ferrari enlisted Juan Manuel Fangio, the 1954 and 1955 world champion. To dominate the competition, Scuderia Ferrari also bought and used the cars of the Lancia team, the only one that could challenge Mercedes-Benz, but which had disbanded due to financial reasons.

        In the summer of 1955, the most tragic accident in the history of motor racing occurred at Le Mans, when the Mercedes-Benz car driven by Frenchman Pierre Levegh caused an accident that killed 77 people, including the driver, and injured another 77. Immediately after the accident, Mercedes-Benz management decided to withdraw their racing team from all competitions, including Formula 1, at the end of the season. The accident led to the prohibition of all motor racing in Switzerland, including the Swiss Grand Prix.

        In 1968, Matra, Ken Tyrrell, and Jackie Stewart managed to win three races, but in 1969, they dominated the season decisively, winning both world titles. An accident at Monaco in 1969 led to the banning of front and rear wings, but these were reintroduced a year later, this time regulated by the federation. The year 1968 will remain in Formula 1 history not only as the year Jim Clark died but also for two other aspects, without which Formula 1 today would be different. The first had commercial value: in 1968, commercial sponsors were accepted into Formula 1. Until then, only companies directly related to automobiles — oil, fuel, and tire manufacturers — were allowed to sponsor teams and races. Lotus was the first team to sign such a commercial agreement, with Imperial Tobacco, promoting the Gold Leaf brand. The second had technical value: front and rear wings were used for the first time in Formula 1, significantly increasing the importance of aerodynamics in the construction of Formula 1 single-seaters.

        After Ferrari managed to resume their winning streak in 1974, they easily won both world titles in 1975, beginning a dominance that would last for three seasons and include five world titles. Only the 1976 drivers' championship was not won by Ferrari, but this was only after two events they could not control: first, Niki Lauda suffered an accident during that year's German Grand Prix at Nürburgring, which kept him out of racing for several weeks, and then the same Austrian refused to compete in the Japanese Grand Prix at Mount Fuji, thus ceding the title to James Hunt, Emerson Fittipaldi's replacement at McLaren and his good friend. Lauda's attitude at Mount Fuji was not at all appreciated by his team's management, so as soon as the Austrian won the 1977 world title, he was fired.

        Formula 1 had already become one of the most-watched sports in the world, with races televised live across the globe. This attracted a series of powerful sponsors to the championship, which led to increased demands from the teams. On the other hand, the new regulations promulgated by FISA favored automobile manufacturers with their own teams in Formula 1, as these had greater financial possibilities than private teams, so the battle was fought on two fronts — commercial rights and technical regulations.

        Although Frank Williams enjoyed a very good relationship with Honda, it broke down when the Briton refused to include Satoru Nakajima, a Japanese Honda factory driver, in the team. The pretext for the contract termination, however, was the accident suffered by Frank Williams in 1986, an accident that left him semi-paralyzed, in a wheelchair. At that time, Honda believed that Williams could no longer manage his team as he had before and announced that they would not renew the contract expiring in 1987. Migrating to McLaren, Honda also brought Ayrton Senna with them, a young Brazilian driver who had already used Honda engines at Lotus. Ayrton Senna won the world title in 1988 and was the moral winner of the 1989 championship. In their first year together, in 1988, McLaren and Honda won 15 out of 16 races, accumulating 199 points. They would have easily won the sixteenth as well, but it was given as a gift to Scuderia Ferrari as a tribute to Enzo Ferrari's death in August 1988.

        After winning the world title in 1994, albeit after a tough fight with Damon Hill of Williams, none other than the son of Graham Hill, the former world champion of 1962 and 1968, Michael Schumacher repeated the performance in 1995, when the entire season was a stroll in the park. That year, Benetton won their first and only world title in the constructors' championship. After many years, in 1997, Ferrari built a car with title-contending potential, and Michael Schumacher's performance could not disappoint, with the German battling for the ultimate crown until the final round. He ultimately lost to Jacques Villeneuve, who had taken over the lead driver position at Williams from Damon Hill. Williams also won the constructors' championship.

        The title won by Scuderia Ferrari in 1999 was just the beginning of a period of categorical dominance that extended until 2004, with the Italians winning six consecutive constructors' world titles, if we include the 1999 one, and five consecutive drivers' world titles, all through Michael Schumacher. In 2000, Michael Schumacher had a very strong start to the season, taking a considerable lead in the championship, but also a weaker period in the summer months, allowing Mika Hakkinen to catch up and even overtake the German. But Schumacher finished the season in style, with four victories in the last four races, and ultimately won his third world title and the first drivers' title for Scuderia Ferrari in over two decades. The same Michael Schumacher also won in 2001 and 2002, this time with less effort.

        With Ferrari out of the title fight in 2005, Fernando Alonso and Kimi Räikkönen battled for the title. Ultimately, the former prevailed, also due to the fact that the Mercedes engines used by Räikkönen's McLaren were particularly weak, often exploding. Fernando Alonso and Renault also triumphed in 2006 in the battle for both world titles, but after a knife-edge fight with Michael Schumacher and Scuderia Ferrari, who returned after a year's absence from the top fight. For McLaren, the "Spygate" issue was worse, in which Ferrari engineer Nigel Stepney transmitted a dossier of technical secrets to Mike Coughlan, McLaren's chief designer. This led to a record fine of $100 million from the FIA, and McLaren was excluded from the championship. In the 2008 season, things continued in the same direction. Lewis Hamilton managed to win the title against Felipe Massa in an unforgettable manner. In the last race in Brazil, Massa managed to win his home race and was champion. However, his fulfilled dream was short-lived because Hamilton, who was in 6th place, needed at least 5th place, and so in the last lap, at the penultimate corner, Hamilton overtook Timo Glock and moved into the position that secured him the World Championship by one point over Massa.

        2010 saw several changes in regulations. KERS and double diffusers were banned for the 2010 season, but innovative new car features, such as F-duct, were introduced. An allocation of eight engines per driver for the entire season was also introduced as part of more cost-cutting methods. The biggest change in the F1 scoring system in history occurred between 2009 and 2010. The 10–8–6–5–4–3–2–1 point system for the top eight drivers (in operation since 2003) was replaced by a drastically different 25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1 system for the top 10 drivers.

        The 2010 season was a classic campaign, culminating in a four-way battle for the title in the final round in Abu Dhabi. The Red Bull RB6 was the class of the field, and Vettel was a worthy champion – 10 pole positions and five victories (including winning the last two rounds) were enough to crown the youngest champion to date. After their dominance in 2011, Red Bull started the 2012 season slowly. However, Adrian Newey and his team developed the RB8, so Vettel won five times and teammate Mark Webber twice. Fernando Alonso also won two races, in a car that did not come close to the RB8. Sebastian Vettel kept the World Championship in the most dramatic style. Leading Alonso and Ferrari in the last race in Brazil, Vettel collided with Bruno Senna on the opening lap. He then managed an exceptional drive to finish sixth. With Jenson Button in first place holding Alonso behind him, the German won the title by three points over the Spaniard.

        Four years of Red Bull dominance finally ended with new engine regulations that Mercedes-Benz exploited to perfection. The FIA specified 1.6-liter turbocharged hybrid engines for 2014, complete with complicated energy recovery systems. Mercedes was the team to beat, and by a larger margin than expected before the season. Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg won all but three races, but the higher management's decision not to impose team orders on the drivers created a classic battle. Both entered the final race in Abu Dhabi with title chances, but Hamilton was the one who won for the 11th time and secured his second world title. Any thought that Mercedes would have a challenger for the 2015 Formula 1 Season was eliminated from the first race of the season. Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg qualified on the front row in 15 of the 19 races and finished 1-2 on 12 occasions. Hamilton won the title again for the third time in his career. Mercedes won the 2016 Formula 1 World Championship for the third consecutive year, but there was fiercer competition between its two drivers. This year it was Nico Rosberg who emerged from the tense season finale in Abu Dhabi as champion, five points ahead of Hamilton. Five days after achieving his childhood dream, Nico Rosberg stunned the sport by announcing his immediate retirement from the sport.

        With new aerodynamic regulations, Mercedes was threatened by competitors. In 2017, the German constructor had tighter competition for the title, with Ferrari producing a more advanced car for Sebastian Vettel. Although Vettel led the championship at the summer break, in the second half of the season Hamilton and Mercedes countered, and the Englishman won 5 out of the remaining 9 races to secure his fourth title and equal his rival. 2018 continued in the same vein with Hamilton and Vettel aiming to win their fifth title each. Vettel started the season by winning the opening two races, and Ferrari was the fastest car for much of the year, but Hamilton and Mercedes dominated once again. The Englishman combined excellent qualifying with tireless speed and consistency in the race. In contrast, Vettel made too many mistakes, including the unforced accident while leading the race in Germany. Vettel's victory in Belgium seemed to restore the championship's rhythm, but he did not win again.

        Mercedes successfully navigated the two seasons in which it was threatened, and in 2019, it had no rivals. Hamilton won his sixth career title with 3 races to spare, and Mercedes once again dominated the constructors' championship, winning their sixth consecutive World Championship. The 2020 season was to be an unprecedented one. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which shook the entire world, the start of the season was delayed. Ultimately, the season began in July (something that had never happened before in history), with the Austrian Grand Prix. As expected, the season was chaotic, but the only thing that didn't change was the leader. Although the teams were hampered by the pandemic situation, failing to have many testing days, Mercedes remained the best on the grid once again. Lewis Hamilton won 11 of the 17 races in the season and secured his seventh title, a performance that places him alongside Michael Schumacher for the most titles won. Mercedes also managed to win the constructors' title again without problems, being their seventh consecutive title and in their overall record. Through this, Mercedes broke the record for most consecutive titles won by a constructor (7), securing the titles from 2014-2020. The previous record was held by Ferrari, which had won six titles between the 1999 and 2004 seasons.
